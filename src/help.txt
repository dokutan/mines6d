Board

The board is 6-dimensional with coordinates given as (x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅, x₆).
It is possible to use fewer dimensions by restricting some xₙ to 1,
e.g. choosing (x₁, x₂, x₃, 1, 1, 1) as a board size results in a 3-dimensional
board.
Currently only the von Neumann neigborhood is supported, i.e. each cell has up
to 12 adjacent cells.

Views

Multiple views of the board are shown at the same time, all are slices along
x₄₋₆.

Cheats

It is possible to specify a limited number of cheats, when used they reveal
the true state of a cell. This is intended to reduce the number of situations
where guessing is required.

Controls

a, d    movement along x₁
w, s    movement along x₂
q, e    movement along x₃
j, l    movement along x₄
i, k    movement along x₅
u, o    movement along x₆
f       flag a cell as containing a mine
r       mark a cell as maybe containing a mine
c       use a cheat
Space   uncover a cell
Esc     quit the game
F1      show the help
